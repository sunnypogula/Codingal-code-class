            <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
            <p>
                The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)
                is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also
                called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred 
                from an extinct population of wolves during the Lat
                Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the 
                first species to be domesticated by humans, over 
                14,000 years ago and before the development of 
                agriculture. Due to their long association with
                humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on 
                a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for 
                other canids.

            <p>
                Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory
                capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds 
                vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have 
                the same number of bones (with the exception of
                the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth,
                and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight.
                Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell
                and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles
                for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,
                companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting 
                police and the military.
