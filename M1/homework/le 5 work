            <h2>Facts About Lions</h2>
            <p>
                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus
                Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular
                broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears;
                and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually
                 dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have
                a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
                prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related 
                and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying 
                mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex 
                and keystone predator

                The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is 
                usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, 
                it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the 
                Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, 
                from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented 
                populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. 
                It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because 
                populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early
                1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. 
                Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and 
                conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
